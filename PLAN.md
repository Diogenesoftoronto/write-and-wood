first need to make the component to display the prompt. 

to do this will start making stuff with mui and draw the basic setup with figma.

after doing that i will have the home page with the prompt component

the prompt component will then have an answer or post to answer the prompts the answer is then delivered to the server. 

after doing this create a timer system to start a timer to make sure there is a limited time to make the posts or answers

post words per minute and other stats with a stats toggle. Other dashboarding details can also be added in a user's dashboard section.
