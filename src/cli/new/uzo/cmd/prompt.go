	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	promptCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVarP(&File, "file", "f", "", "A File name to unzip and open in IDE")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// ideaCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
