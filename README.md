# Write-and-wood

a creative writing game that challenges writers to answer prompts.


## About

When I was in highschool, I had a creative writing class where the teacher had us answer a prompt given with a given theme within the first fifteen minutes of the class. We then shared what some of us had written.

This application takes such an excersise and makes it into a game. Taking that to the logical extreme, it creates a series of free form challenges with a wide variety of themes and prompts that challenges writers to improve their abilities and skills. 

Share your creations with the community, extend others' responses, make your own prompts, and participate in writing events and competitions.
